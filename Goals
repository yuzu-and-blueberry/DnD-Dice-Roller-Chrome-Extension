- Multiple dice with different CSS shapes that roll out the desired dice. 
    It would be nice to make this a pop up menu from the bottom with icons of the dice we want, from there we can click an icon of the dice we want to change the interface. 
- A way to save multiple rolls, this should be a toggle function. 
- Number animation that animates number counting randomly before stopping after 1 or 2 seconds with our desired random number.
